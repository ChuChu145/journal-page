                    <p class = "intro"> I am a tech enthusiast, my aim is to become a Cybersecurity specialist,
                        but for now I am learning the frontend development path which is a skill I believe will
                        make me a better Cybersecurity specialist.

                <h2 class="featured-h2">Who I Am</h2>
                <p> I see myself as a student of life, problem solver and a tech enthusiast. I believe the cyber
                    space should be a safe space that is regulated to build a trusting and thriving human 
                    community, which is what drives my quest to learning what and how codes work. 
                    Outside of coding, you will find me playing chess, or at the gym lifting weight as 
                    I am big on becoming the best version of myself.
                </p>
                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>My journey into tech has been relatively new, but I am loving every bit of the challenges
                    so far, I am more than excited for what the future holds and I am very positive that I 
                    belong in the industry.
                </p>
